# Web-Design-Challenge
During this project, I used concepts that I have learned, such as HTML and CSS, to create a dashboard featuring the Latitude vs. X analysis of weather. First, I added an index.html file in the main folder, and later editted this file to be the landing page that a user first encounters. I created a website using the weather data and images that are provided for this Challenge. As I built this dashboard, I created a page for each plot and a way to navigate among these pages. These pages contain visualizations and descriptions. I also created two more pages, a landing page that provides a comparison of all the plots and a page that represents the data used to build the plots.

# assets
This folder contains my CSS and image files.

# Resources
This folder contains cities.csv, the CSV file containing the data for my website.

# visualizations
This folder contains cloudiness.html, humidity.html, temp.html and wind.html, the HTML pages that display my visualizations.

# Deploying index.html to GitHub Pages
Next, I deployed my index.html file to GitHub Pages.
